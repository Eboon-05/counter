# Counter

Small counter made with React, Redux and Tailwind CSS.

## Scripts

- `dev`: Start the dev server and make the dev build.
- `build`: Make the production build.
- `preview`: Preview.
- `lint`: Run ESLint.
- `serve`: Serve the content of the dist folder in localhost as SPA.

## PWA testing

You will need many terminal tabs.

1. Run `npm run build` for making the build. You will have to re-run on every change.
2. Use the `npm run serve` for serving the dist folder.
3. In my case, I use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for making the page `https` for testing on mobile.
